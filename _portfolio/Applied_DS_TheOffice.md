# Applied Data Science to The Office TV Show

Exploring The Office (U.S) transcipt data with `pandas`, `nltk`, `NetworkX`

## Motivation 

After completing a series of courses in Applied Data Science in Python from University of Michigan, I wanted to put the skills and knowledge that I have learned into a fun project.
The Office (U.S) was always around during my college years at Oregon State. My roommate had it playing in the living room all the time. Somehow Prison Mike was a popular sticker on my campus along with DutchBros. Some of my friends even named their cats after Dwight and Kevin from the show.
Then it hit me. I should apply my newfound skills to see the insight on what the data says about the show. From there, I knew what my fun project would be.
Let’s get started!

## Exploring the data
I downloaded the dialogue/transcript from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/nasirkhalid24/the-office-us-complete-dialoguetranscript). All the code is written in `python` using the popular libraries `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `nltk`, `NetworkX`, `NRClex`(TextBlob)

## The characters
While there are many frequent characters, there are 4 in particular that are arguably the main cast: Michael, Dwight, Jim, Pam. Some people argue that certain characters are more prominent, however let’s see what the data actually says by plotting the lines spoken by the characters.
